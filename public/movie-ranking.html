<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
<p>Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner. Gardner has invested heavily in a device known as 
    a "bone density scanner". He feels like he has it made selling these devices. However, they do not sell well as 
    they are marginally better than x-ray at a much higher price. As Gardner works to make ends meet, his wife leaves 
    him and he loses his apartment. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner continues to sell bone 
    density scanners while concurrently taking on an unpaid internship as a stockbroker, with slim chances for 
    advancement to a paid position. Before he can receive pay, he needs to outshine the competition through 6 months 
    of training, and to sell his devices to stay afloat.—John Wiggins, Alf Fonz

<h3>The Book of Eli</h3>
<p>In a violent post-apocalyptic society, a drifter, Eli (Denzel Washington), has been wandering westward across 
    North America for the last thirty years. He finds solace in a unique book which he carries on his person and guards 
    closely, while surviving by hunting small animals and seeking goods in destroyed houses and vehicles to trade in 
    villages for water and supplies. When he reaches a village ruled by the powerful mobster, Carnegie (Gary Oldman), 
    the man views Eli's impressive fighting skills and offers Eli a place within his gang. Carnegie presses his blind 
    lover Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to send her daughter, Solara (Mila Kunis), to at least convince Eli to spend the 
    night by sleeping with him. However, Eli proves to be the better man when he gently declines her advances. 
    The girl sees Eli's book, and when Carnegie finds out he beats her mother until she reveals what she saw. Carnegie 
    sends his gang into the wasteland to take the book from Eli, but the man proves to be a formidable foe as he makes 
    it more than clear that if they want the book, they must first take his life.—Harry Jankel, London, England
